#### ðŸ‘€ My Interests

I love working on projects that involve a variety of concepts and tech stacks. Iâ€™m interested in developing software to solve real-world problems and have a knack for coming up with creative, yet practical solutions. Also, I love a good aesthetic with clean design and documentation, and try to incorporate it into all of my projects.
