I am a software developer and a Computer Science graduate from the University of Waterloo.

#### ðŸ‘€ My Interests

I am passionate about full stack development, distributed systems, and artificial intelligence, especially designing scalable, high-performance software that solves complex real-world problems. I enjoy working on projects that span diverse technologies and concepts, always aiming to craft creative yet practical solutions. Additionally, I value clean design and thorough documentation, striving to incorporate both aesthetics and clarity into every project I undertake.
